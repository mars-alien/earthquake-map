# 🌍 Interactive Earthquake Map

An interactive web application built with **Streamlit**, **Folium**, and the **USGS Earthquake API**.  
This project visualizes recent earthquakes worldwide, allowing users to **filter by magnitude** and **search locations**, with dynamic clustering on a map.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Real-time Data** – Fetches earthquake data directly from [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/).
- ✅ **Interactive Map** – Explore earthquakes on a Folium map with zoom & pan.
- ✅ **Magnitude Filters** – Adjust minimum magnitude dynamically.
- ✅ **Search by Location** – Quickly locate earthquakes near a place.
- ✅ **Marker Clustering** – Group nearby earthquakes for better visualization.
- ✅ **CSV Export** – Download filtered earthquake data for offline use.
- ✅ **Deployment Ready** – Works locally and deploys smoothly on Streamlit Cloud.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/earthquake-map.git
cd earthquake-map
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Fetch latest earthquake data
python src/fetch_data.py

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run src/app.py

🔧 Configuration

Data Source: USGS "All Earthquakes, Past 7 Days" feed
→ CSV Feed Link

Output Files:

data/earthquakes.csv → raw data

outputs/earthquakes_map.html → static map export

📦 Deployment

This project is ready to deploy on:

Streamlit Cloud (1-click deploy)

Heroku / Render (with requirements.txt)

Docker (optional: build a container for deployment)

Example for Streamlit Cloud:

Push repo to GitHub

Go to Streamlit Cloud

Create new app → point to src/app.py
