# 🌍 Interactive Earthquake Map

An interactive web application built with **Streamlit**, **Folium**, and the **USGS Earthquake API**.  
This project visualizes recent earthquakes worldwide, allowing users to **filter by magnitude** and **search locations**, with dynamic clustering on a map.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Real-time Data** – Fetches earthquake data directly from [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/).
- ✅ **Interactive Map** – Explore earthquakes on a Folium map with zoom & pan.
- ✅ **Magnitude Filters** – Adjust minimum magnitude dynamically.
- ✅ **Search by Location** – Quickly locate earthquakes near a place.
- ✅ **Marker Clustering** – Group nearby earthquakes for better visualization.
- ✅ **CSV Export** – Download filtered earthquake data for offline use.
- ✅ **Deployment Ready** – Works locally and deploys smoothly on Streamlit Cloud.
